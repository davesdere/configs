I love algo. It is easy to use VPN project that just need some helper functions.
I am not making a pull request yet because I mainly use AWS for this and ALGO supports bunch of provider.

# TODO  

- Create an IAM policy to be able to only deploy an Algo VPN
- Create an IAM policy to only be able to start, stop, and configure SG to restict Ingress to client IP
- Wrap this up in CF
